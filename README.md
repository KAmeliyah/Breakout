**SDL2 Brick Breaker Game**  
This game is a solo development project that I've done to explore using text files for level layouts.  
Using C++ and SDL2, I've made a brick breaker game that builds levels using text files for block placements.  
It took about a week to make, and I've been making a few adjustments periodically to improve upon my work.  

**Controls**
